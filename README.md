# AI-Code-Debugger
A beginner-friendly Streamlit app that checks  code for syntax errors and uses OpenAI to fix and explain mistakes.


# AI Code Debugger

A beginner-friendly web app built with **Streamlit** and **OpenAI API** that helps users **debug their Python code**.  
It checks for syntax errors and uses AI to fix mistakes and explain what went wrong.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to help users:
- Check if their Python code has syntax errors.
- Automatically fix the code using AI (ChatGPT).
- Get easy-to-understand explanations about their mistakes.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Streamlit
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 API
- Python `ast` or `compile()` for syntax checking

---

## ✨ Features (Planned)
- Paste Python code into a text box.
- Click a button to debug the code.
- View syntax errors immediately.
- Use AI to fix the code and explain errors.
- (Optional) Download the corrected code.

## 📚 Learning Steps Behind the Project
| Skill | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| Python | Core logic handling |
| Streamlit | Building the user interface |
| Python `compile()` | Checking syntax without running |
| OpenAI API | AI-driven code fixing |
| Basic API Concepts | Sending and receiving data between app and AI |

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Idea)
1. User pastes Python code into the app.
2. App checks the code for syntax errors.
3. If needed, it sends the code to OpenAI.
4. AI fixes the code and explains the errors.
5. Results are shown to the user.
